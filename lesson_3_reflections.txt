Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?
A: When there are more than one person working on the project it seems like a 
good idea.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Other than using the bandwidth... I really don't see it! 

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?
A: Forks are clones in github. They are traced and monitored by the github app. 
Clones are copies of git repositories into new locations.
Branches are different paths in commit graph in a repository.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?
A: It makes it possible to know when we have diverged from the remote.
