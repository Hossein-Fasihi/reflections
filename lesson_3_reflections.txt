Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?
A: When there are more than one person working on the project it seems like a 
good idea.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Other than using the bandwidth... I really don't see it! 

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?
A: Forks are clones in github. They are traced and monitored by the github app. 
Clones are copies of git repositories into new locations.
Branches are different paths in commit graph in a repository.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?
A: It makes it possible to know when we have diverged from the remote.

Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, 
and what would be harder?
A: Other than other SCM solutions. A shared file system on a remote server... 
probably. Then all sorts of things could go wrong. Confict could go unhandled, 
one could write over the other. Keeping versions, branches and all that jazz 
would be impossible.

Q: When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly
in master? What benefits does each approach have?
A: When the differenct I'm making in a different context than the original flow 
of development. Or when it could be the case. e.g. When collaborating, one would
be better off creating his/her ideas into new branches and ask for others
opinion before merging into master.
