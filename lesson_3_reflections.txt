Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?
A: When there are more than one person working on the project it seems like a 
good idea.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Other than using the bandwidth... I really don't see it!
